"""Exact per-camera ``inspection_data.json`` in the V4 Train-Inspection-Engine
schema, for all four camera angles.

This module is the SINGLE owner of that contract.  It is a faithful port of
`reporting/json_builder.py` from
``s2pl/CCTV-TrainVideo-ML-V2-wagon-Rithish@V4/Train-Inspection-Engine``: the same
two flavours, the same key names, the same key ORDER, the same derivations.  The
only thing that changes is where the numbers come from -- the V4 engine reads its
own per-camera pandas frames, while here every value is derived from finalized
global_train artifacts (the sealed GlobalTrainState, the fused UnifiedWagonStates,
and each camera's own per-feature JSON + evidence).

Two flavours (V4 vocabulary, verbatim)
--------------------------------------
Top cameras (``RIGHT_UP_TOP``, ``LEFT_UP_TOP``) -- ``flavour="top"``
  * ``segment_type``: ``wagon_empty`` / ``wagon_loaded`` / ``engine`` / ``brakevan``
  * ``segment_type_map[str(seg_id)]`` = ``{type, number, wagon_count}``
  * per-wagon: 3 damage booleans (``floor_dmg`` / ``inner_wall_dmg`` /
    ``floor_dmg_probable``) + ``load_status``
  * top-level: ``floor_dmg_wagons``, ``inner_wall_dmg_wagons``,
    ``floor_dmg_probable_wagons``, ``probable_damage_wagons``
  * ``rake_status`` = majority vote of this camera's loaded vs empty wagons
  * ``loco_number_results`` = ``{}``

Side cameras (``RIGHT_UP``, ``LEFT_UP``) -- ``flavour="side"``
  * ``segment_type``: ``wagon`` / ``engine`` / ``brakevan`` (no load split)
  * ``segment_type_map[str(seg_id)]`` = ``{type, number}``
  * per-wagon: ``door_status`` + ``door_close_detected`` + ``door_partial_detected``
    + ``damage_detected``
  * top-level: ``doors_open``, ``doors_partially_closed``, ``doors_closed``,
    ``damaged_wagons``
  * ``rake_status`` inferred from travel ``direction`` (left-to-right = Loaded)
  * ``wagon_number_results`` keyed by ``str(wagon_count)``

Camera authority is respected (this is what makes the four files differ):
``RIGHT_UP`` reports the right door + OCR, ``LEFT_UP`` the left door,
``RIGHT_UP_TOP`` / ``LEFT_UP_TOP`` each report their OWN load + damage reads --
never the other camera's.  A field this camera has no authority for is reported
from its own per-camera state or left at the schema's neutral value; it is never
back-filled from a different camera.

Everything here is PURE: it reads already-written JSON + checks for the existence
of evidence JPEGs, and returns a dict.  No model, no video, no network, no writes.
