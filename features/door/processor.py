"""Door feature processor (v4, train-state-native, ALL legacy intelligence
ported).

Per wagon, for each side camera (RIGHT_UP / LEFT_UP):

    1. Iterate cached JPEGs in wagon_cache/<GW_n>/<camera>/.
    2. Run YOLO door_state.pt on the raw frame (fp32 -- CPU build).
    3. Apply the model's own confidence gate.
    4. Feed surviving detections into the legacy DoorTracker (Kalman +
       Hungarian + per-track 30-frame quality-weighted majority vote +
       state machine with 2x hysteresis on OPEN -> CLOSED transitions +
       sticky DAMAGE state).
    5. After all frames, finalize the tracker -> per-track {state,
       confidence, snapshot}.
    6. Run DoorIdentityMerger to collapse fragmented tracks of the same
       physical door (spatial + temporal + context + structural).
    7. Pick the dominant door state per CAMERA SIDE (kept for the existing
       left_door / right_door contract), AND emit one entry per DISTINCT
       physical door with its own representative snapshot.

A wagon side can show two or more distinct doors in different states (door 1
CLOSED, door 2 OPEN). Steps 5-6 already establish door identity -- the tracker
groups a door's frames into one track and DoorIdentityMerger collapses
fragmented tracks of the same physical door; the sampled path's
EvidenceAggregator does the same through its candidates. So the identity is not
invented here: `doors[]` simply stops discarding it, and each door carries its
own best frame instead of one snapshot per side.

REMOVED from this path (both modules remain on disk, untouched; Door was
their only consumer):

  * IlluminationProcessor -- was inert.  The call passed a `frame_idx=`
    kwarg the method does not accept, raising TypeError on every frame;
    the bare `except` pinned quality to 1.0.  Now hard-coded to 1.0, so
    the tracker receives exactly the same value as before.
  * GeometricShapePrior -- calibrated for PORTRAIT doors, while these
    side cameras see LANDSCAPE doors.  It rejected 100% of real
    detections on aspect and vertical-edge grounds, starved the tracker
    below n_init, and on LEFT_UP discarded an OPEN_DOOR detection,
    yielding a false CLOSED.  See the inline note at the call site for
    the measured before/after.

The per-CAMERA dominant state IS the per-side door state (RIGHT_UP -> right
door, LEFT_UP -> left door).  Same convention the legacy combined report
used.

    Returns the SAME 6-tuple as `_run_tracker_one_camera`, so `run()` below is
    identical for both modes: same `_pick_side_state`, same `_resolve_evidence`,
    same evidence files, same JSON.  Only how detections are gathered differs.

    Why this exists: Door spends ~97% of its wall clock in YOLO, so the only
    real lever is fewer calls.  Plain stride-2 against the legacy tracker
    failed because `n_init`/`min_hits_for_decision` are ABSOLUTE hit counts
    that halve with the sample rate (GW_21 6->2, GW_22 8->2, both losing the
    LEFT_UP track).  EvidenceAggregator replaces that with a support FRACTION,
    which is stride-invariant.  The tracker is NOT used here and its thresholds
    are therefore neither read nor modified.

    Deliberately unchanged from legacy: the model, the confidence gate, the
    class mapping, and the evidence-bucket keying -- including the known
    `_canonical()` bucket-key quirk.  Replicating that quirk keeps the A/B
    comparison clean; fixing it here would conflate two changes.
